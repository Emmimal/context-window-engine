# context-window-engine

Proves that larger context windows don't fix RAG on structured data — they make wrong answers harder to detect. Then solves it with a query router that prevents RAG from being used for aggregation in the first place.

Zero external dependencies. Pure Python 3.9+ stdlib only. No API keys. No LLM calls. Fully reproducible.

## The Finding

When you ask a RAG pipeline "What is the total spend by category?" on 100,000 rows, it retrieves a small number of rows as plain text and passes them to an LLM. The LLM cannot sum, group, or compare numerically. It returns a wrong number.

The assumption is that a larger context window fixes this. It does not.

At 5 rows, the error is obvious — the response is short and clearly a guess.  
At 8,000 rows (~520K tokens), the error is nearly invisible — the response is 1,500 words, authoritative, and structurally wrong.

Coverage of the actual 100K-row dataset at 8,000 rows: **8.0%**. Coverage against the full 1.29M-row dataset: **0.62%**.

I call this **Error Observability Collapse**: confidence scales with context, correctness does not.

The semantic engine scans all 100,000 rows in a single deterministic pass and returns the exact answer in under 200ms. No inference. No hallucination.

## The Solution

A `QueryRouter` sits in front of your pipeline and classifies every incoming query before it reaches RAG.

Computation queries (`total`, `how many`, `average`, `greater than`) are dispatched to the SemanticEngine — exact, deterministic, full-scan.  
Retrieval queries (`find`, `show me`, `list`) are passed to RAG as normal — where RAG is actually appropriate.

```
Query: "What is the total spend by category?"
→ COMPUTATION  →  SemanticEngine  →  exact answer in 102ms

Query: "Find transactions from Jennifer Banks"
→ RETRIEVAL    →  RAG             →  appropriate — no aggregation required
```

Error Observability Collapse cannot occur if aggregation queries never reach RAG.

## What the Benchmark Shows

Seven queries across three aggregation types, measured at five context window sizes:

| Query | Semantic Engine | 5-row RAG | 8K-row RAG |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total spend by category | exact, 100ms | obvious error | hidden error |
| Highest avg transaction by category | exact, 99ms | obvious error | hidden error |
| Total spent on grocery_pos | exact, 50ms | obvious error | hidden error |
| Female transaction count | exact, 90ms | obvious error | hidden error |
| Total spend > $500 | exact, 91ms | obvious error | hidden error |
| State with lowest spending | exact, 101ms | obvious error | hidden error |
| Fraud transaction rate | exact, 80ms | obvious error | hidden error |

### Confidence escalation — the core finding

As context size grows, LLM responses become more specific, more detailed, and more convincing — while remaining structurally wrong.

| Context Window | Rows | Coverage | Specificity | Response length | Error visible? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~325 tokens | 5 | 0.0050% | 0.225 | ~50 words | YES — obviously a guess |
| ~3K tokens | 50 | 0.0500% | 0.563 | ~150 words | MAYBE |
| ~32K tokens | 500 | 0.5000% | 0.784 | ~400 words | HARD |
| ~130K tokens | 2,000 | 2.0000% | 0.892 | ~800 words | VERY HARD |
| ~520K tokens | 8,000 | 8.0000% | 1.000 | ~1,500 words | NEAR IMPOSSIBLE |
| **Semantic Engine** | **100,000** | **100%** | **exact** | **<200ms** | **N/A** |

medium (~32K tokens)   500   0.5000%      31,023.21  HARD
large  (~130K tokens) 2,000  2.0000%     140,093.16  VERY HARD
xlarge (~520K tokens) 8,000  8.0000%     569,368.22  NEAR IMPOSSIBLE
```

### Router routing accuracy

| Query | Routed to | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Total spend by category | SemanticEngine | exact |
| Highest average transaction | SemanticEngine | exact |
| Total spent on grocery_pos | SemanticEngine | exact |
| How many female customers | SemanticEngine | exact |
| Total spend > $500 | SemanticEngine | exact |
| State with lowest spending | SemanticEngine | exact |
| Percentage fraudulent | SemanticEngine | exact |
| Find transactions from Jennifer Banks | RAG | appropriate |
| Show me a sample transaction from Texas | RAG | appropriate |

9/9 correct. All 7 aggregation queries intercepted before reaching RAG.

## How It Works

### Semantic engine

Parses natural language queries into aggregation operations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX), applies categorical and numeric filters, and executes a single-pass scan over the full dataset. No model calls. No retrieval. Deterministic output.

```python
from context_window_engine import compute_ground_truth, load_csv

rows = load_csv("data/credit_card_transactions.csv", max_rows=100_000)

gt = compute_ground_truth(
    query_label = "total by category",
    rows        = rows,
    agg_func    = "sum",
    agg_col     = "amt",
    group_col   = "category",
)
print(gt.answer)       # exact grouped totals, deterministic
print(gt.latency_ms)   # typically < 200ms on 100k rows
```

### Query router

Classifies every natural language query into COMPUTATION or RETRIEVAL using a three-tier pattern classifier, then dispatches to the correct execution path.

```python
from context_window_engine import load_csv
from query_router import QueryRouter

rows = load_csv("data/credit_card_transactions.csv", max_rows=100_000)
router = QueryRouter(rows)

result = router.route("What is the total spend by category?")
print(result.routed_to)        # "COMPUTATION"
print(result.answer.answer)    # exact grouped totals — same as SemanticEngine
print(result.total_latency)    # classify + execute, typically < 250ms

result = router.route("Find transactions from Jennifer Banks")
print(result.routed_to)        # "RETRIEVAL"
print(result.answer.safe)      # True — RAG is appropriate for lookup queries
```

### Classification tiers

| Tier | Signal | Example | Route |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Aggregation verb | `total`, `how many`, `average`, `lowest`, `percentage` | COMPUTATION |
| 2 | Numeric comparison | `greater than 500`, `above $1000`, `at least` | COMPUTATION |
| 3 | Retrieval signal | `find`, `show me`, `list`, `fetch` | RETRIEVAL |
| 0 | No match | (defaults to safer choice) | COMPUTATION |

### RAG simulation

Simulates what a naive vector RAG pipeline passes to an LLM at each context size. Scores rows by keyword overlap (BM25-style), retrieves top-k, serialises as plain text. Measures confidence signals at each context size: categories visible, partial sum, and detectability score.

```python
from context_window_engine import simulate_rag_retrieval

ctx = simulate_rag_retrieval(
    query        = "What is the total spend by category?",
    rows         = rows,
    context_size = 500,
)
print(ctx.coverage_pct)           # 0.5% of dataset
print(ctx.confidence_signals)     # categories visible, partial sum, detectability
```

### Aggregation operations supported

| Operation | Example query |
|---|---|
| SUM + GROUP BY | "What is total spend by category?" |
| AVG + GROUP BY | "Which category has the highest average?" |
| COUNT + filter | "How many female customers?" |
| SUM + categorical filter | "Total spent on grocery_pos?" |
| SUM + numeric comparison | "Total spend where amount > $500?" |
| MIN/MAX + GROUP BY | "Which state has the lowest spending?" |
| Ratio / percentage | "What percentage of transactions are fraudulent?" |

## Honest Limitations

**Single-table only.** The engine operates on one CSV at a time. JOIN operations across multiple tables are not supported.

**Keyword-based router.** Intent classification uses regex patterns and keyword matching, not semantic understanding. Queries outside the supported vocabulary default to COMPUTATION — the safer failure mode.

**Simulated LLM responses.** The RAG baseline simulates what an LLM receives and models confidence signals — it does not make real API calls. The confidence metrics are proxies, not measured outputs.

**CSV format required.** The engine loads structured data from CSV. Database connections and other formats are not supported.

## Dataset

The benchmark uses the Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection dataset by Kartik Gajjar (kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection), a synthetic dataset generated using Brandon Harris's Sparkov simulator. Licensed CC0 (Public Domain). The full dataset contains 1,296,675 rows across 14 spending categories. The demo loads 100,000 rows by default. Pass `--full` to run against the complete dataset.

---

## Disclosure

All benchmark numbers are from actual runs on Python 3.12.6, Windows 11, CPU only, no GPU. The RAG baseline simulates retrieval and models confidence signals — no real LLM API calls are made. No external API keys are required to reproduce any result.
